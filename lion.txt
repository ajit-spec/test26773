Lions are known as the "king of the jungle," although they primarily live in grasslands and savannas. They are apex predators and play a crucial role in their ecosystems.
These majestic cats live in social groups called prides, which typically consist of related females and their cubs, along with a few adult males.
Lions are the only big cats that live in groups, making them unique among feline species.
